      				<td><p style="text-align:left">To elucidate the dynamics, I develop a novel learning and inference framework through a "Data-Driven & Knowledge-Based (DD-KB) approach" that combines data and knowledge. In this framework, when a user inputs information on the system components (state variables) of interest, multivariate time-series observational data <i>O</i> and background theory or background knowledge <i>B</i> (expressed as causal networks or logic programs) are automatically retrieved by online queries to databases or domain-specific knowledge bases to construct networks and differential equations. Its strength lies in its ability to derive scalable, robust, and interpretable models from noisy or partially observable data. The workflow is as follows.</p>
      				<ul>
      				<li><p style="text-align:left">First, a data-driven directed and undirected mixed network or causal network is constructed purely from data <i>O</i>. Knowledge <i>B</i> is used to check the meaning of each edge of the data-driven network and transform the network into a data-driven and knowledge-based network with validation. Knowledge <i>B</i> can also be used for the abduction of latent variables in the causal network. When a latent variable is detected, the latent variable is added as a new variable, and the related time-series data and background knowledge are acquired similarly via the API and automatically added to the model.</p></li>
      				<li><p style="text-align:left">Second, the DD-KB network constructed from <i>O</i> and <i>B</i> is transformed into a system of differential equations as candidate outputs.</p></li>
      				<li><p style="text-align:left">Third, the dynamic behavior of the differential equations is examined, including prediction accuracy and stability (model verification). Models are simplified by parameter pruning using sensitivity indices. Iterative expansion of the model, reduction of its dimensionality, and evaluation of the model using model selection criteria help to avoid overfitting.</p></li>
      				<li><p style="text-align:left">In this way, a causal and differential equation system that has undergone model verification and validation are obtained.</p></li>

    		<p style="text-align:left">I am struggling to decide whether to focus on R&D or on effectively communicating the results of a bird's-eye view of various fields of research to industry, government, and academia through written and visual expression. However, in case that I continue to do research, I have had some idea of the fields I would like to be involved in since around 2015. It is in the field of Earth and planetary systems (disciplines include Earth and planetary systems science, climate informatics, systems ecology, ecological economics, etc.). In my doctoral program, I have been working on a microscopic system of intra-host viral infection, but I would like to work on a more macroscopic Earth and planetary system as an application of the DD-KB approach framework. This topic may seem far away from the viruses I have been dealing with, but in fact, I consider it to be very close. For example, both viral infection systems and Earth and planetary systems are complex systems with multiscale and multiphysics properties, and they share the same formal expression in the sense that they are based on a network structure composed of time-evolving entities. They also have in common that they are (or should be) compatible with the DD-KB approach. There are two representative models related to the Earth and planetary systems: the Earth System Model (ESM) and the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM). The ESM is closer to natural science and data-driven (downscaling by deep learning to achieve large scale and high accuracy) model consisting of material cycles such as biogeochemical cycles or the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), while the IAM is closer to social science and knowledge/model driven model interacting with socio-economic processes, such as behavior change of human groups and policy making (emphasizing causality and interpretability and aiming for simplicity). More recently, coupling these two models into a global-scale model has also been studied. I believe that the DD-KB approach will enable ESM-IAM coupled modeling for evidence-based policy making (EBPM), which is based on big data but can also explain the rationale behind the results. Because of the real-time properties of Earth's satellite data, it may be called the "Earth Digital Twin" built on the metaverse rather than a simulation model. Furthermore, the fact that marine viruses (marine virome) form a huge biomass and have a significant impact on marine ecosystems is an example of a situation where my biological knowledge can be put to good use. In addition, I have always been fond of graphical things, from my youth when I wanted to be a cartoonist or CG animator to the present day when I am into simulation and data visualization (although recently I have been more interested in the development of the theoretical basis of AI...). Therefore, I am thinking of contributing to Socially Engaged Art (SEA) by using 3DCG and high-performance supercomputers to express these scientific digital twins in a semi-artistic way. Through the above attempts, I would like to conduct R&D in cooperation with various stakeholders, with the major goals of further understanding the mechanisms of the Earth and planetary systems (basic research aspect) and contributing to evidence-based policy making and advocacy to realize a safe and secure society and sustainable development in the Anthropocene (applied research aspect).</p>
    		
    		<a name="003"></a><p style="text-align:left"><b>Why Earth?</b></p>
        <p style="text-align:left">The above mentioned reason is the high affinity of the DD-KB approach, and in fact, this approach can be applied to anything as long as we have data and knowledge. I would like to explain why I am so interested in the Earth and planetary systems. In fact, I have been interested in the sustainability of the human race and the global environment since I was in high school, or even as far back as junior high school, influenced by Osamu Tezuka's "Phoenix" and Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring." For example, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (the current SDGs) include the eradication of poverty and hunger, the reduction of infant mortality (and the resulting control of population explosion), and the sustainable development of the global environment. I was fascinated by the life of the late Dr. Tetsu Nakamura (especially his "Green Earth Project") and decided to study epidemiology and infectious diseases in the tropics at Nagasaki University School of Medicine, the Mecca of infectious disease research in Japan. However, when I actually entered medical school, I was confronted with a typical career path as a doctor that was like a stamp rally on a rail, and the gap between the reality of medicine and the high-minded ideal I had envisioned, and I began to question the "virtue of self-sacrifice through hard work" and lost my passion for medicine. I spent many days wondering about my chosen career path. I even took a year off from school to pursue a career in art (Being an artist is another face of mine. I am still creating indie games as my hobby. At the time, I was thinking of making it my main career). After returning to medical school, I knocked on the door of a laboratory at the Institute of Tropical Medicine and began to learn how to conduct research, which led me to mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Simulation using mathematical models was so much fun that I forgot to eat or sleep because of its visual impact and my love of planning strategies, and this became the basis for my current research. In my research life, I have always had an awareness of sustainability since childhood, and I have encountered interesting topics related to the Earth and planetary systems, such as the "Gaia hypothesis (theory)" and the "Svensmark effect," as I searched through various resources. Although my research interests have undergone many changes and twists and turns, I have always had an underlying desire to "contribute to the safe protection of something that is currently in danger because it has been abused or neglected in the past, so that it can be better in the future." This feeling has never changed, even though it has sometimes been the socially vulnerable citizens who have been marginalized and isolated, such as certain groups of patients, or the global Earth environment. This background has led me to want to work on Earth and planetary systems after completing my Ph.D.</p> -->

Considering existing equation discovery techniques have not explicitly discovered causality, The efforts in this study are dedicated to learning causal network topology from temporal data based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for robustness to adversarial noise and incorporating it into equation discovery for less model complexity. I conjectured that observational causal discovery could limit the search space in equation discovery and prevent models from overfitting due to those terms that are irrelevant to the causal model.

The meaning of all the edges in this correlation network were carefully examined using seven knowledge bases. To analyze what types of pathways are activated in data, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in which the validated network model were mapped onto function-known pathway database KEGG.

      				<td><p style="text-align:left">As globalization has increased capital investment in international economic markets, it has become increasingly important to understand and control the dynamic changes in power relations among nations and the corporate investment strategies of nations. In this study, big data on stock ownership was derived from Bureau van Dijk, including 300 million firms and 140 million directors and shareholders, percolation rules, and depth-first search algorithms to extract subnetworks (groups of owned and controlled firms such that one shareholder is the ultimate owner) hidden in the global network structure of ownership  [Odaka and Mizuno <i>IPSJ</i> 2019](c1-2, d4-8, e1-2). Analyzing data allowed us to measure the scale of corporate ownership and control, including direct and indirect ownership and control linkages. In addition to visualizing the measured scale and attempting to discover knowledge, a hypothesis-testing data analysis was conducted. Corporate ownership and control scale were measured and visualized by extracting a partial network in which the Chinese government is the ultimate shareholder. Progressive reduction of the shareholding required for corporate ownership increased corporate ownership for French and South African (financial, services, manufacturing, and mining industries) firms and firms in tax havens. The trend for Japanese and Polish firms was toward controlling micro and small businesses. Network analysis was performed by extracting partial networks where the ultimate shareholder is a shareholder coalition formed by multiple shareholder alliances. China, the U.S., and GAFA were defined as shareholder alliances. Both China and the U.S. increased their ownership size through alliances. The ownership size relationship between China and the U.S. is reversed when the threshold is progressively reduced. The U.S. partial network is scale-free and rapidly increaseed its ownership size through hub firms. There was the difference in investment strategy between China's concentrated investment and the U.S.'s diversified investment. GAFAs do not increase in size through alliances but rather through business linkages. In addition, a similar extraction was performed for the historical data set to observe the dynamics of control size. The results were compared for China, the U.S., France, Germany, and Japan, where the final shareholders are China, the U.S., France, Germany, and Japan. China showed a steady increase, possibly due to the impact of Chineseization through the One Belt, One Road initiative. The U.S. was in a steady decline due to the global recession. France and Germany were staying the same as the U.S., while Japan was increasing the size of its dominance in Thailand and Hong Kong, possibly due to Abenomics.</p></td>

This assumption allows us to consider that targeting malaria hotspots cannot work well because the relationship in R0 can be false corresponding to parameter settings. If the effect on R0 of parameter settings is clarified, theoretically optimum vaccination strategy would be predicted for a pragmatic malaria vaccine trial, which started in 2019. Here the purpose of this study was to simulate the effectiveness (the level of prevalence decline after completing vaccination to half of the total population) corresponding to transmission intensity. The SEI-SI models was built in the heterogeneous or homogeneous biting setting with vaccination coverage of two types of vaccines: sporozoite (SpV) and transmission-blocking (TBV).

The increase in the emergence population of SpV and TBV made the effectiveness more significant in targeting the low-risk group. The effectiveness of SpV exceeded that of TBV. A little effect of vaccination caused this inverse phenomenon compared to regular vector supply, like "a drop in the ocean." Sensitivity analysis using the one-factor-at-a-time method (OFAT) and canonical discriminant analysis (about  30,000 iterations) allowed to find that the human recovery rate needs to be carefully set. Overall, targeting malaria hotspots can be counterproductive when transmission intensity is high.</p></td>
